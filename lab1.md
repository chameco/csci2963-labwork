The Open Source Definition
--------------------------
Being familiar with Richard Stallman's Free Software movement, I was struck by the ideological "softness" (for lack of a better word) of the Open Source Definition. Particularly, if I am interpreting point nine, which states that open source software must not place restrictions upon other software distributed upon the same medium, correctly, this calls to mind some frequent debate surrounding the GNU GPL: namely, that a program that uses a GPL software library must also be licensed under the GPL. Within the Free Software movement, this has lead to the creation of alternate licenses such as the LGPL. I would posit that these differences reflect underlying differences in the projects' motivations. The Open Source movement seems to me to be primarily concerned with the development of better software using collaboration as a tool, where Free Software is more about the modification and examination of software being a fundamental human right.
